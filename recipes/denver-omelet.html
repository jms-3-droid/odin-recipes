        <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>This is a chicken and dumpling recipe from <a href="https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/263567/the-denver-omelet/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">allrecipes</a>. The Denver omelet is by some people's definitions not an omelet. Is it fancy? no. Is it a French classic? no. Is it a delicious parcel of eggs and cheese with additional flavorful ingredients? oh yeah.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>3 large eggs</li>
                <li>1 tbsp butter</li>
                <li>1/4 cup diced smoked ham</li>
                <li>2 tbsp diced onion</li>
                <li>2 tbsp diced green bell pepper</li>
                <li>Salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste</li>
                <li>1/3 cup shredded cheddar cheese</li>
                <li>1 pinch cayenne pepper</li>
            </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Beat eggs in a small bowl until just combined. Do not overbeat.</li>
                <li>Melt butter in a skillet over medium-high heat. Add ham, onion, and bell pepper. Season with salt and pepper. Cook and stir until onions soften and ham begins to caramelize (~5 minutes).</li>
                <li>Reduce heat to medium-low and pour in eggs. Mix briefly with a spatula while shaking the pan to ensure ingredients are evenly distributed.</li>
                <li>Quickly run the spatula along the edges of the omelet.</li>
                <li>Sprinkle the cheese and cayenne pepper over the omelet.</li>
                <li>Cook, shaking the pan occasionally, until the top is wet but not runny, ~5 minutes. Use a spatula to fold the omelet in half and trnsfer it to a plate.</li>
                <li>Garnish (or don't) and enjoy!</li>
            </ol>
