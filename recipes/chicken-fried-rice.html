        <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>This is a chicken fried rice recipe from <a href="https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/16954/chinese-chicken-fried-rice-ii/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">allrecipes</a>. Chicken fried rice is one of those fridge-cleaning recipes that you can kind of throw anything you want into and it'll turn out fine. Any chopped vegetables you have lying around will do fine like broccoli, cauliflower, carrots, leeks, asparagus, (maybe celery, maybe not? try it!). As long as you get the basics down, the rest is up to you.</p>
